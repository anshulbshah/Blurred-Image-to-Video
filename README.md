# Blurred Image to Video
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02913.pdf) 
Built a deep architecture to extract a temporally consistent video from a motion blurred images. The work is first of its kind as the traditional algorithms extract only a single deblurred image. The model uses a recurrent network built using ConvLSTM cells.
