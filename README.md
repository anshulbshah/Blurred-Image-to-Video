# Blurred Image to Video

### Paper is under review at CVPR'18. Code will be made available soon. 
Built a deep architecture to extract a temporally consistent video from a motion blurred images. The work is first of its kind as the traditional algorithms extract only a single deblurred image. The model uses a recurrent network built using ConvLSTM cells.
